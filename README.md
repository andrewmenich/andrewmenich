## Welcome
Thanks for stopping by! I've been busy at work at [Madhouse](https://madmadmad.com) as a developer where I plan, develop, and maintain beautiful websites and web applications. I have experience on both the front end and back end using a variety of languages and technologies, including Craft CMS - our CMS of choice. My real talent is not in any one particular language or framework, however, but in my ability to solve problems. 

### Blog
I've recently started a blog where I plan to write about things I've learned, found helpful, or have strong feelings about. You can view it in its infancy here: [https://andrewmeni.ch](https://andrewmeni.ch)
